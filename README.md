# Regression-Housing-PricingProject-3for-Fathers-who-want-to-buy-a-House-Predicting-Housing-Prices
In this project I have develop and evaluate neural network models using Keras for a regression problem



In this step-by-step project, you will know:

•	How to load a CSV dataset and make it available to Keras.

•	How to create a neural network model with Keras for a regression problem.

•	How to use scikit-learn with Keras to evaluate models using cross-validation.

•	How to perform data preparation in order to improve skill with Keras models.

•	How to tune the network topology of models with Keras

## And what we get
Reasonable performance for models evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) are around 
20 in squared thousands of dollars (or $4,500 if you take the square root). 
This is a nice target to aim for with our neural network model.
## About Dataset

The problem that we will look at in this project is the Boston house price dataset (This dataset is also used in chapter 3 of our text book).

We have download the dataset for free and placed it in the project directory with the filename “housing.csv“. You can also directly download the dataset:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/housing.data

The dataset describes 13 numerical properties of houses in Boston suburbs and is concerned with modeling the price of houses in those suburbs in thousands of dollars. As such, this is a regression predictive modeling problem. Input attributes include things like crime rate, proportion of nonretail business acres, chemical concentrations and more.

This is a well-studied problem in machine learning. It is convenient to work with because all of the input and output attributes are numerical and there are 506 instances to work with.
